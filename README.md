# Final-Project-Computational-Physics-II
The repository includes a python packageto solve 1D advection problems using a finite volume approach and different slope limitersand, a standalone python module to simulate a two-body problem. and a python routine using MPI parallelisation that solves the heat equation through FFT method. Each part of the project has its own folder.
